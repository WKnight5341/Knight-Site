## Intro
My name is Will Knight, and I am a current second year student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Robotics and Manufacturing Engineering Technology at Rochester Institute of Technology.

As of now, this website will primarily serve as an open source of documentation for any personal projects that I may create. Yes, it's very barebones, but it's the best that I can do as a non-webdev student with an already busy schedule.

## Goals
In the past, I had my run with a wide variety of personal projects and fabrication methods. Much of my past project documentation can actually be found [here](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/charlotte/students/william-knight/#assignments/week08/), and while it definitely represents a large portion of my skill set, that site hasn't been touched in about three years now.

Going forwards, I want to redo some of my old favorite projects with the improved skill set that I have now after a year at RIT, and I also want to create some new and unique projects that build towards the future. 

## Navigation

Navigation throughout this website should be fairly simple. The left sidebar contains headers for both Personal and School projects, which you should be able to click through and view in more detail. The Personal Projects section contains projects that are either completed or in progress, while the RIT Projects section may contain examples of either independent or collaborative projects that I completed as part of a course or a club here at RIT.
